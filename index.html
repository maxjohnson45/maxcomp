<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language. In this case, United States English. Search engines, browsers, and screen readers use this information to deliver content specific to user needs.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">

<head>
<!--The <head> element contains additional information for search engines and browsers.--> 
<!--The <title> tag controls the name on the browser tab and the next line of code adds a favicon image.-->

<!--This viewport <meta> tag standard tells browsers how to display the website across different sized screens.-->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

<!--This <link> (rel)ates to the cascading style sheet or CSS in your project folder. Web designers use CSS to add styling to a website. Using CSS saves time and results in fewer lines of code.-->

<!--The <body> element organizes all of the code and content that actually appears on a screen. You can change the background color by opening the style.css document in the body tag properties. Choose a color with enough contrast for your audience. Neutral colors work best for the greatest number of viewers.-->

<!--Glitch a .jpg image by editing the source code. Open the digital image file using “text/edit” on Macs (located in Launchpad/other), "Notepad" on Windows, or "text" on Chromebooks (located in App launcher). Make a test glitch: scroll down to the middle of the document. Copy, cut, move, and paste 10-20 lines of code. Hit save. Then open the original image to see what has changed. Once you understand your reference position, you can begin glitching with more precision.   
   
To add your glitch image, simply find and delete the hero.jpg file in the project folder. Then name your glitched image file to the project folder and name it "hero.jpg." If an image is larger than 1200px in width, you will want to resize it speed up load time. Crop image height to ensure desired fit.--> 

<!--The "hero-image" properties are controlled on the style.css document. We know this because the <div> calls the class="hero-image". You can open the style.css file and find the hero-image class to edit its properties. Alternatively you can edit the file height by cropping the image to fit within the hero-image.-->

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I grew up in the Chartiers Valley School District (30 mins away) my entire life, and I decided to come to Pitt because while I wanted to get out there, I did not want to be too far from home. In high school, I played drums in the marching band, and I have always been passionate about music and could talk for hours about my favorite albums. Here at Pitt, I plan to major in communications, but I am keeping an open mind to other possibilities and trying out other things.</p>

Add images to your project folder and make sure the file name/type matches in your code. Resize images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time accessibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Everyday Code</h2>
    <p>Code affects our everyday life because technology is so prominent in everyday society, and every website or app we interact with is created by several lines of code. After completing the activity and tracking my screen time for five days straight, I saw that I spend way more time on social media than I thought I did. Since I was tracking over labor day weekend, I had a lot more free time than I would have during a normal school day. The data has encouraged me to find other more beneficial ways to spend my free time and be mindful of when I am pointlessly scrolling on Tiktok.</p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Code and digital technology impact on education</h2>
    <p>Digital technology has affected the way we learn because it allows for anyone to put information on the internet. While this does make it far easier to find information and gain knowledge on pretty much any topic, it also opens the door for less accurate information if you aren't checking a credible source. Understanding code & digital technology also helps aspiring artists and creators to have a platform for other people to see the projects they have been working on.</p>
